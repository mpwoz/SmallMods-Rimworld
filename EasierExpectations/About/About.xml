        Allows you to set the min and max "expectation" mood buffs. Want to make it easier? Increase the "min bonus"
        to something higher than zero for a permanent mood bonus, even at sky high expectation level.
        
        Harder? Decrease the max bonus so your colonists start with less of a bonus at 'extremely low' expectations
        when you're just starting out.
        
        Tweak the values however you wish, all intermediate steps are automatically calculated to be evenly spaced out
        between the values you decide on.
